 Deep learning is a field of machine learning utilizing massive neural networks, massive datasets, and accelerated computing on GPUs.
 
 PyTorch is an open-source Python framework from the Facebook AI Research team used for developing deep neural networks. 
 I like to think of PyTorch as an extension of Numpy that has some convenience classes for defining neural networks and accelerated computations using GPUs
 
 I have learned that all deep learning is regression line/curve fitting and optimizing. 
 
 Take for example a linear classification model with y = 2x1 + x2 - 18=0, as it's equation. 
 
 x1 = Test scores
 x2 = Grade score
 
 Based on these features alone, our model classifies into accepted(1) or rejected(0)
 
 yhat = the prediction
 yhat = 1 if y > 0 and 0 if y < 0
 
 
what is the score of the student who got 7 in the test and 6 for grades?

(y = 2*7 + 6 - 18) = 2

yhat = 1 if y > 0

therefore this student passed above the regression line.

clear? :) 

Perceptron.

Error Functions.

Gradient Descent.
- this is an adaptive method by which a function (line/curve) adjusts its orientation to minimize an error function.

QUIZ QUESTION
Which of the following conditions should be met in order to apply gradient descent? (Check all that apply.)
- differentiable and continuous.

Discrete vs Continuous predictions.

discrete = yes/no.
countinuous = probability.

Activation function: Step (discrete) vs Sigmoid (continuous) .
